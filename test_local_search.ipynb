      "Most Similar Text: Bug, Fault, Error, or Weakness: Demystifying Software Security Vulnerabilities -CONCLUSIONThe results from ChatGPT queries show we must rely on more than just AI to discern concepts. Underthe ChatGPT's hood lays a model that learns from all over the Internet, including misunderstandings. In parallel to the ancient Oracle of Delphi, the caller should be well prepared to provide the right questions and context; otherwise, the reasoning may be misleading and the result disastrous. Using our software security expertise to pose more and more tuned questions, thus providing more context, eventually we got ChatGPT to at least partially discern our own reasoning. The collective knowledge seems to approve the direction we are delving in via our BF research.\n",

As different vulnerabilities may be associated with the same weakness type, we could look at a weakness type as a class and a vulnerability as an instance of that class. Although it is uncommon, a single vulnerability could be associated with two or more weaknesses exploited sequentially or in parallel.
